# Basic Form built in React.js and Flask Python

### Frontend

Form built in React.js with the following inputs:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Age

The frontend assesses the validity of the form. If the form is valid, it sends a POST request to the backend
Then, the backend stores the data in a database.

### Backend

Backend built in Flask.
Only one route is needed: "/add_user" to store the user in the database.
